- made atm_management_system_v2 
- better ui and prevents from sql injection
- use preparedStatement -> precompiled sql query which makes the structure of query at compile time and values as a string fetch akrta h aur structure ke fill in blanks ke jagah par jaake rakh deta h
- instead of statement -> execute the query directly to your database
- use hashing to convert pin into hash code. This code can't be unhashed making our database safe even if someone get access,they can't get the pin directly.
- add pin change page ,helps when you forgot pin.
- and small small more fixes are done
